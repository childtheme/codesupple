# Polylang Text Widget

A WordPress plugin that allows you to display language-specific content in widgets, integrated with the **Polylang** plugin. This widget enables you to define and show different content based on the current language selected by the user.

## Features

- **Multilingual Support**: Display different content for each language (e.g., English, Arabic) using the Polylang plugin.
- **Gutenberg Integration**: Allows users to insert Gutenberg blocks into the widget content.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple settings page to define language-specific text content.
- **Dynamic Display**: Content in the widget automatically switches based on the active language.

## Installation

1. Download and install the **Polylang Text Widget** plugin.
2. Go to **Settings > Polylang Text Widget** in your WordPress dashboard to configure content for each language.
3. Add the Polylang widget to any sidebar via **Appearance > Widgets** and select the language for each version of the widget.

## How It Works

The plugin creates a widget that allows you to define content separately for each language (e.g., English and Arabic). The widget content dynamically updates based on the selected language. You can use Gutenberg blocks within the content, and it will be rendered on the front end.
