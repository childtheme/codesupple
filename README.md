Hello and welcome to my CodeSupply plugin page!

Currently, you can find the Customizer Import and Free Elementor Footer plugins here, both fully compatible and designed to work seamlessly with the Maag WordPress theme.

Custom Footer for Elementor (Free Version).
A plugin to add a custom footer using the free version of Elementor.

Steps to Set Up the Plugin

1. Once you've created the plugin, go to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to Plugins, and activate the Custom Footer for Elementor (Free Version) plugin.

2. Create an Elementor Footer Template:

Go to Elementor → Templates → Saved Templates.
Click Add New, choose Section, and design your footer using Elementor’s free version.
Publish the footer template.
Assign the Footer Template in Plugin Settings:

3. After activating the plugin, go to Settings → Custom Footer in your WordPress dashboard.
Select the footer template you created from the dropdown list and click Save Footer Template.

Once the footer is set, it will automatically display on your website as the custom footer.
